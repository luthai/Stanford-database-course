Q1. For every situation where student A likes student B, but student B likes a different student C, return the names and grades of A, B, and C. 

SELECT H3.name, H3.grade, H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade
FROM Likes L1, Likes L2, Highschooler H1,
    Highschooler H2, Highschooler H3
WHERE L1.ID1 = L2.ID2
AND L1.ID2 <> L2.ID1
AND H1.ID = L1.ID1
AND H2.ID = L1.ID2
AND H3.ID = L2.ID1

----------------------------------------

SELECT H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade, H3.name, H3.grade 
FROM Likes L1, Likes L2, Highschooler H1,
    Highschooler H2, Highschooler H3
WHERE L1.ID2 = L2.ID1
AND L1.ID1 <> L2.ID2
AND H1.ID = L1.ID1
AND H2.ID = L1.ID2
AND H3.ID = L2.ID2


Q2. Find those students for whom all of their friends are in different grades from themselves. Return the students' names and grades. 

SELECT name, grade
FROM Highschooler, (
	SELECT DISTINCT ID1
	FROM Friend
	EXCEPT
	SELECT DISTINCT F1.ID1
	FROM Friend F1, Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2
	WHERE F1.ID1 = H1.ID
	AND F1.ID2 = H2.ID
	AND H1.grade = H2.grade) AS temp
WHERE ID = temp.ID1


Q3. What is the average number of friends per student? (Your result should be just one number.) 

SELECT AVG(temp.friends)
FROM (
    SELECT *, COUNT(*) AS friends
    FROM Friend F1
    GROUP By ID1) AS temp
	
	
Q4. Find the number of students who are either friends with Cassandra or are friends of friends of Cassandra. Do not count Cassandra, even though technically she is a friend of a friend.
