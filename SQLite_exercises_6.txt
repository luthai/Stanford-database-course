	SELECT Likes.ID1
	FROM Friend, Likes
	WHERE Friend.ID1 = Likes.ID1
	AND Friend.ID2 = Likes.ID2)
AND ID2 NOT IN (
	SELECT Likes.ID1

SELECT DISTINCT F1.ID1, F2.ID2
FROM Friend F1, Friend F2
WHERE F1.ID2 = F2.ID1
AND F1.ID1 <> F2.ID2
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT F3.ID1, F3.ID2
    FROM Friend F3
    WHERE F3.ID1 = F1.ID1
    AND F3.ID2 = F2.ID2)
