Q1. Find the names of all reviewers who rated Gone with the Wind.

SELECT DISTINCT(name)
FROM Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating NATURAL JOIN Reviewer
WHERE title = "Gone with the Wind"


Q2. For any rating where the reviewer is the same as the director of the movie, return the reviewer name, movie title, and number of stars.

SELECT name, title, stars
FROM Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating NATURAL JOIN Reviewer
WHERE name = director


Q3. Return all reviewer names and movie names together in a single list, alphabetized. 
(Sorting by the first name of the reviewer and first word in the title is fine; no need for special processing on last names or removing "The".) 

SELECT title
FROM Movie
UNION
SELECT name FROM Reviewer

Q4. Find the titles of all movies not reviewed by Chris Jackson. 

SELECT title
FROM Movie
EXCEPT
SELECT title
FROM Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating NATURAL JOIN Reviewer
WHERE name = "Chris Jackson"
