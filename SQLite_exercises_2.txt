Q1. Find the names of all reviewers who rated Gone with the Wind.

SELECT DISTINCT(name)
FROM Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating NATURAL JOIN Reviewer
WHERE title = "Gone with the Wind"


Q2. For any rating where the reviewer is the same as the director of the movie, return the reviewer name, movie title, and number of stars.

SELECT name, title, stars
FROM Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating NATURAL JOIN Reviewer
WHERE name = director


Q3. Return all reviewer names and movie names together in a single list, alphabetized. 
(Sorting by the first name of the reviewer and first word in the title is fine; no need for special processing on last names or removing "The".) 

SELECT title
FROM Movie
UNION
SELECT name FROM Reviewer


Q4. Find the titles of all movies not reviewed by Chris Jackson. 

SELECT title
FROM Movie
EXCEPT
SELECT title
FROM Movie NATURAL JOIN Rating NATURAL JOIN Reviewer
WHERE name = "Chris Jackson"


Q5. For all pairs of reviewers such that both reviewers gave a rating to the same movie, return the names of both reviewers. 
Eliminate duplicates, don't pair reviewers with themselves, and include each pair only once. For each pair, return the names in the pair in alphabetical order. 	

SELECT DISTINCT reviewer.name, temp.name 
FROM Rating rating NATURAL JOIN Reviewer reviewer
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT *
    FROM Rating NATURAL JOIN Reviewer
    GROUP BY mID, name) temp
WHERE temp.mID = rating.mID AND temp.name != reviewer.name AND reviewer.name < temp.name
