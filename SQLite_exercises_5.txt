Q1. Add the reviewer Roger Ebert to your database, with an rID of 209. 

INSERT INTO Reviewer (
    rID, name)
VALUES
    (209, "Roger Ebert");
	

Q2. Insert 5-star ratings by James Cameron for all movies in the database. Leave the review date as NULL. 

INSERT INTO Rating (rID, mID, stars, ratingDate)
SELECT Reviewer.rID, Movie.mID, 5, null 
FROM Movie
LEFT OUTER JOIN Reviewer
WHERE Reviewer.name = "James Cameron"


Q3. For all movies that have an average rating of 4 stars or higher, add 25 to the release year. (Update the existing tuples; don't insert new tuples.) 


UPDATE Movie
SET year = year + 25
WHERE mID in (
    SELECT mID
    FROM Movie
    NATURAL JOIN
        (SELECT *, AVG(stars) AS avgstars
        FROM Rating
        GROUP BY mID) AS temp
    WHERE temp.avgstars >= 4)
	

Q4. Remove all ratings where the movie's year is before 1970 or after 2000, and the rating is fewer than 4 stars.

DELETE
FROM RATING
WHERE mID IN (
    SELECT mID
    FROM Movie
    WHERE year NOT BETWEEN 1970 AND 2000)
AND stars < 4
